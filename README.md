## Cameroon Birth and Death Rates from 1990 - 2024
This chart illustrates long-term trends in Cameroon’s crude birth and death rates from 1960 to 2024. Birth rates remain consistently higher than death rates, confirming sustained natural population growth, while the steady decline in both indicators reflects a gradual demographic transition driven by improved survival, health conditions, and slowly declining fertility over time.

## Cameroon Maternal, Under-5, Child, and Infant Mortality from 1990 - 2024
This figure shows substantial long-term improvements in maternal, infant, neonatal, and under-five survival in Cameroon from 1990 to 2024. While maternal and child mortality have declined markedly over time, the slower reduction in neonatal mortality highlights persistent risks in the first days of life, underscoring the need for sustained investments in maternal care, skilled birth attendance, and newborn health services to accelerate progress and close remaining gaps.

## Cameroon Dependency Ratio from 1990 - 2024
This chart illustrates how Cameroon’s growing population has increased pressure on the working-age group (15–64) from 1960 to 2024, as they support both a large child population (0–14) and a gradually expanding older population (65+). Despite growth in the workforce for both women and men, the persistent size of the child population and the emerging rise in older adults highlight a sustained demographic burden, underscoring the importance of job creation, productivity gains, and strengthened social protection systems.

## HIV Incidence and Prevalence in Cameroon among youths from 1990 - 2024
This visualization shows the evolution of HIV incidence and prevalence among young people aged 15–24 in Cameroon from 1990 to 2024. After a rapid rise and peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both incidence and prevalence decline steadily, reflecting significant progress in HIV prevention and treatment, while the persistently higher prevalence among young women highlights ongoing gender disparities and the need for targeted youth- and gender-responsive interventions.

## Cameroon's GDP growth from 1960 - 2024 compared to other Central African Countries
This chart compares Cameroon’s GDP trajectory from 1960 to 2024 with other Western and Central African countries, placing national growth in a broader regional context. While Nigeria dominates in absolute economic size, Cameroon’s GDP shows a steadier and more sustained expansion than many peers, positioning it among the leading mid-sized economies in the region despite periods of regional and global economic volatility.

## DPT1 Coverage
This map presents DPT1 vaccination coverage across countries in the WHO African Region in 2022, highlighting substantial variation in immunization performance. While several countries have achieved coverage levels above 90%, others remain below the 80% threshold, underscoring persistent inequities in routine immunization and the need for targeted strategies to reach zero-dose and under-immunized children.
