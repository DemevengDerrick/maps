## Demographic Analysis

### Cameroon Birth and Death Rates (1960–2024)
Long-term trends in Cameroon's crude birth and death rates revealing sustained natural population growth. The steady decline in both indicators reflects a gradual demographic transition driven by improved survival, health conditions, and slowly declining fertility.

### Mortality Trends: Maternal, Under-5, Child, and Infant (1990–2024)
Analysis of substantial long-term improvements in maternal, infant, neonatal, and under-five survival in Cameroon. The slower reduction in neonatal mortality highlights persistent risks in the first days of life, underscoring the need for sustained investments in maternal care and newborn health services.

### Dependency Ratio Analysis (1960–2024)
Visualization of demographic pressure on Cameroon's working-age population (15–64), showing how they support both a large child population (0–14) and a gradually expanding older population (65+). This analysis highlights the importance of job creation, productivity gains, and strengthened social protection systems.

## Public Health Analytics

### HIV Incidence and Prevalence Among Youth (1990–2024)
Evolution of HIV incidence and prevalence among young people aged 15–24 in Cameroon. After a peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both indicators decline steadily, while persistently higher prevalence among young women highlights ongoing gender disparities requiring targeted interventions.

### Waterborne Disease Analysis (Multi-Method Approach)

#### Choropleth Distribution
Spatial distribution of reported disease cases across Africa, revealing geographic clustering and hotspots of higher burden. The concentration of cases in specific regions highlights spatial inequities in disease transmission and reporting.

![Disease Cases](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d07e9c-0436-413e-b2d3-2ff33cb9987f)

---

#### Bivariate Mapping: Cases vs. Deaths
Joint spatial distribution of disease cases and deaths across Africa, highlighting areas where high incidence coincides with high mortality. Darker shades reveal priority hotspots with elevated health burden and severity.

![Bivariate Map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce89cb4-ec17-4f75-882d-9f72fbc45ff4)

---

#### Hotspot Analysis (Spatial Autocorrelation)
Statistically significant clusters of high and low disease burden identified using spatial autocorrelation methods. High-confidence hotspots reveal areas of concentrated transmission, providing actionable evidence for prioritizing surveillance and resource allocation.

#### Disease-Specific Cluster Analysis (2019–2023)
Multi-panel spatial cluster analysis of major waterborne diseases (malaria, diarrhoea, dengue, cholera, typhoid) across the WHO African Region. Recurring hotspots along river basins, lake regions, and densely populated corridors underscore links between water systems, environmental conditions, and disease transmission.

## Economic Analysis

### GDP Growth: Cameroon vs. CEMAC Countries (1960–2024)
Comparative analysis highlighting Cameroon's sustained and resilient economic expansion relative to other CEMAC countries. While peer economies show greater volatility, Cameroon's steady trajectory has widened its economic lead within the sub-region.
